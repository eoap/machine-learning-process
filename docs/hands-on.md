# Hands-on

- Tile-based Training implementation:
Open the [documention](./training-cwl.md) of training component and execute different runs with different model's hyperparameter by following [this instructions](../training/app-package/README.md). 
- Run Stage-in:
Open the [documentation](./stage-in.md) to learn how to stage-in the Sentinel-2 L1C products. 
- Tile-based Inference implementation:
Open the [documention](./inference-cwl.md) of inference component and execute different runs with different staged-in products.
- Describing the ML model:
Open the [documentation](./mlm.md.md) of MLM component and execute the notebook.
