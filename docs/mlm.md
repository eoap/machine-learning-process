# Describes a trained machine learning model 
This Item describe a trained machine learning model using [MLM](https://github.com/stac-extensions/mlm) STAC extension. The STAC Machine Learning Model (MLM) Extension provides a standard set of fields to describe machine learning models trained on overhead imagery and enable running model inference.

The main objectives of the extension are:

- to enable building model collections that can be searched alongside associated STAC datasets
- record all necessary bands, parameters, modeling artifact locations, and high-level processing steps to deploy an inference service.
